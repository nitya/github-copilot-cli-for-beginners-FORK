# Sample Agent Definitions

This folder contains ready-to-use agent templates for GitHub Copilot CLI.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Copy an agent to your personal agents folder
cp hello-world.agent.md ~/.copilot/agents/

# Or copy to your project for team sharing
cp frontend.agent.md .github/agents/
```

## Sample Files in This Folder

| File | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `hello-world.agent.md` | Minimal example (11 lines) | Learning the format |
| `code-reviewer.agent.md` | Code review specialist | PR reviews, bug hunting |
| `frontend.agent.md` | React/TypeScript expert | Frontend development |

## Agent File Format

Each agent file requires YAML frontmatter with at least a `description` field:

```markdown
---
name: my-agent
description: Brief description of what this agent does
tools: ["read", "edit", "search"]  # Optional: limit available tools
---

# Agent Name

Agent instructions go here...
```

**Available YAML Properties:**

| Property | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `description` | **Yes** | What the agent does |
| `name` | No | Display name (defaults to filename) |
| `tools` | No | List of allowed tools (omit = all). See aliases below. |
| `target` | No | Limit to `vscode` or `github-copilot` only |
| `infer` | No | If `false`, must be manually selected (default: `true`) |

**Tool Aliases**: `read`, `edit`, `search`, `execute` (shell), `web`, `agent`

> 💡 **Note**: The `model` property works in VS Code but is not yet supported in Copilot CLI.

## Agent File Locations

Agents can be stored in:
- `~/.copilot/agents/` - Global agents available in all projects
- `.github/agents/` - Project-specific agents
- `.agent.md` files - VS Code-compatible format

Each agent is a separate file with the `.agent.md` extension.

```bash
# Start with a specific agent
copilot --agent frontend

# Or select an agent interactively during a session
copilot

# The agent's expertise applies to your prompts
> Create a user profile card component

# Switch to a different agent
> /agent
# Select "backend"

> Design a REST endpoint for user preferences
```

## Creating Your Own Agents

1. Create a new file in `~/.copilot/agents/` with `.agent.md` extension
2. Add YAML frontmatter with at least a `description` field
3. Add a descriptive header (e.g., `# Security Agent`)
4. Define the agent's expertise, standards, and behaviors
5. Use the agent with `/agent` or `--agent <name>`

**Tips for effective agents:**
- Be specific about expertise areas
- Include code standards and patterns
- Define what the agent checks for
- Include output format preferences
